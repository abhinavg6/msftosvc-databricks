# msftosvc-databricks
Demo Content for Azure Databricks session during Microsoft Azure Open Source Virtual Conference 2018

## Introduction

In this demo, we'll use [Azure Databricks](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/databricks/) to analyze a public dataset onn [DBFS](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/user-guide/dbfs-databricks-file-system.html), and then store the output data on your own Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Store.

## Instructions

* Create a Azure Databricks Trial Workspace by following steps at https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/getting-started/try-databricks.html (skip step 1 if you already have a Azure account and subscription)
* Download and import the notebooks archive *notebooks/MSFT_OSVC_Demo.dbc* in your user sandbox / workspace by following directions [here](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/user-guide/notebooks/index.html#import-a-notebook)
  * This should create a folder *MSFT_OSVC_Demo* with four Databricks notebooks in it
* Open the notebook *000-Apache_Spark_Overview* and follow directions to a T (use the hyperlinks to navigate between notebooks)
